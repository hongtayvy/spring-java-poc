# Spring Boot - Java 17 Proof of Concept
This is a proof of concept for creating a RESTful api. This contains connecting
a web client to an API which returns a list of types in which you can further search for
(not implmented). 

I used Lombok for additional assistance in creating some of the DTOs and Models.
